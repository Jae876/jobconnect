# JobConnect Netlify Deployment Guide

## Overview
Deploy your JobConnect platform to Netlify with full-stack functionality using Netlify Functions for the backend API.

## Prerequisites
- Netlify account (free)
- GitHub repository with your JobConnect code
- Neon PostgreSQL database (your existing one works)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

### 1.1 Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial JobConnect deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/jobconnect.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 1.2 Build Scripts (Already Configured)
Your project already has the correct build configuration:
- `netlify.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `netlify/functions/server.js` - Serverless backend
- `@vendia/serverless-express` - Installed for serverless compatibility

## Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

### 2.1 Connect Repository
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and login
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
4. Select your JobConnect repository
5. Use these build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist/public`
   - **Functions directory:** `netlify/functions`

### 2.2 Environment Variables
In Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables, add:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_7SQZ0CWMKYyb@ep-raspy-sea-a5c5rduw.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-production-session-key-2025
PGHOST=ep-raspy-sea-a5c5rduw.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=neondb_owner
PGPASSWORD=npg_7SQZ0CWMKYyb
PGDATABASE=neondb
PGSSLMODE=require
```

## Step 3: Domain and SSL

### 3.1 Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In Netlify dashboard → Domain settings
2. Add custom domain: `yourjobconnect.com`
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. SSL certificate is automatically provided

### 3.2 Default Netlify Domain
Your site will be available at: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

## Step 4: Production Optimizations

### 4.1 Build Performance
Already optimized with:
- Vite for fast frontend builds
- esbuild for server bundling
- Tree shaking for smaller bundles

### 4.2 Database Connection
Your existing Neon database works perfectly with Netlify Functions:
- Connection pooling handled automatically
- SSL connections secured
- Same data as your development environment

## Step 5: Continuous Deployment

### 5.1 Automatic Deploys
- Push to `main` branch → Automatic deployment
- Pull requests → Deploy previews
- All builds logged in Netlify dashboard

### 5.2 Build Hooks
Create webhook URLs for external deployment triggers:
1. Site settings → Build & deploy → Build hooks
2. Generate unique URL for CI/CD integration

## Step 6: Monitoring and Logs

### 6.1 Function Logs
- Netlify dashboard → Functions tab
- Real-time logs for API endpoints
- Error tracking and performance metrics

### 6.2 Analytics
- Built-in Netlify Analytics
- Custom tracking via your existing analytics

## Expected Results

✅ **Full JobConnect Platform Live**
- Landing page at your domain
- User registration and authentication
- Job search and applications
- Employer dashboards
- Interview scheduling
- Messaging system

✅ **Same Database**
- All existing users and data preserved
- Real-time updates across all features
- Secure SSL connections

✅ **Professional Domain**
- Custom domain with SSL certificate
- Global CDN for fast loading
- Automatic HTTPS redirect

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure all dependencies in package.json

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Check Neon database is active
- Test connection from Netlify Functions

### API Endpoint Problems
- Functions deploy to `/.netlify/functions/server`
- API routes accessible at `/api/*`
- Check function logs for errors

## Performance Features

- **Global CDN** - Fast loading worldwide
- **Edge Functions** - Low latency API responses
- **Automatic Scaling** - Handles traffic spikes
- **SSL/TLS** - Secure connections
- **Compression** - Optimized asset delivery

Your JobConnect platform will be live and professional, with the same functionality as your local development environment but optimized for production use.

## Cost
